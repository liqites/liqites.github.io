I always want to learn Machine Learning and finally I got time.

I first started with the open class CS 229 Machine Learning from Stanford by Andrew Ng. But I failed after 2 classes, because Andrew Ng skipped some math detail that I forget the knowledge of calculus and linear algebra.

Then I find the Machine Learning by Andrew Ng on [Coursera](http://www.coursera.com/) is great.

The learning curve of class is more gentle, and all math details are covered in the course.

So if you want to learning machine learning, I highly recommend you try this course. All you want to know is the basic knowledge of calculus and linear algebra, which also covered in the course.

Yeah!
